Lecture 7
Learning

Lecture 7: Learning 

Respond (basic hardware), predict (pavlovian software), & 
operate (skinnerian software)

Responding: 
•
•
•

Sensation – the ability to discriminate stimuli 
Reflex – hardwired stimulus-response circuits
Habituation – the circuit breaker 

Predicting: run before the cat sees you
•

Classical conditioning (Pavlov)

•

•

•

10

7.1 Classical conditioning

•

1) Learn associations

• Unconditioned stimulus (cid:0) unconditioned 

response (innate, reflex)

• Conditioned stimulus (cid:0) conditioned response

2) Learn sloppily→Generalization: take what 
you learned in a situation and extend it to 
other similar things (little Albert)

•

•

11

7.1 Classical conditioning

•

•

•

•

•

3) Learn sparingly →Blocking – learning one pattern of relationships rather 
than many

*First learned association “blocks” future ones
4) Learn slowly →Latent inhibition

5) Unlearn slowly →Extinction: previously learned association is 
weakened when pattern is broken

6) Relearn quickly →Spontaneous recovery: after extinction, can relearn 
pattern more quickly

12

7.2 Operant conditioning

•

•

Repeat what works (law of effect): 
•
•

If I do something and something good happens, do that again
If I do something and something bad happens, don’t do it 
again

Schedules of reinforcement 

•

•

Ratio: reward is a function of the number 
of times action is performed.
Interval: reward is a function of how 
long since the last reward.

•

•

Fixed: the ratio or interval is always the 
same 
Variable: ratio or interval averages to a 
certain value.

13

Lecture 8
Memory

Lecture 8: Memory

•

Sensory memory: short-term (a few seconds or less)
•
•

Iconic – visual memory
Echoic – auditory memory 

• Working memory 
Currently active 
Limited capacity: 7 +/- 2 

•
•
Long term memory 
•
•

Explicit – semantic & episodic
Implicit – priming & procedural 

•

15

8.1 Explicit memory

• Distributed representation
•

Semantic memory: factual knowledge 
•
Episodic memory: what you did on Sat. night

Lexical decision task: linked in memory -> fast

•
•

Retrieval: recreating the pattern of neurons that was 
created by those experiences 
•

Retrieval cues serve as “seeds” 

16

8.1 Explicit memory

● Consequences of distributed representations:

•

•

Levels of processing 

Memory is better when encoding emphasizes 
“deep” aspects of a stimulus (such as meaning) 
vs. “shallow” aspects of a stimulus (such as 
place)

Encoding specificity

you will remember better if the way you first 
encoded the information is consistent with the 
way you’ll eventually try to remember it

17

8.1 Explicit memory

● Consequences of distributed representations:

• Context dependence

→ you will remember better if you are 
physically located in the same place you 
learned something

State-dependent memory: not the physical 
place, but the psychological state 

18

8.2 Implicit memory

Priming 

Procedural memory

•
•
• Anterograde amnesia: cannot form new memories since brain injury
•
Retrograde amnesia: cannot remember the past up until the brain 
injury

•

Patient H.M. is really bad at recall and recognition (explicit), but still 
has implicit memories

19

Lecture 9
Decision making

9.1 Expected Utility Theory

• As a decision-maker, your job is to maximize value 
•

Two kinds of errors: 
•
Errors of odds
•
Errors of valuation 
•
Expected value = odds of gain X value of gain 

21

9.2 Errors of odds

•

•

•
•

•

Sample size neglect - larger samples will be less likely to show deviations from 
chance or from the normal rate

Gambler’s fallacy - belief that the likelihood of a chance event is influenced by the 
nature of the events that preceded it 

Conjunction fallacy – probability of X is always higher than probability of X and Y

Availability bias - tendency to think that examples of things that come readily to mind 
are more representative than is actually the case

Planning Fallacy - underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task, 
despite knowledge that previous tasks have generally taken longer than planned

22

9.3 Errors of valuation

•

•

•

•

Presentism – tendency to overweight things that are present in mind right now 
Delay of gratification- holding out now for better outcomes later

Endowment effect – application of prospect theory with respect to ownership 
(losses loom larger than gains)

Temporal discounting – discounting the value of something if it’s further away in 
time 

Comparing to the past – preferring the option that shows gradual increase from 
the past 

23

Lecture 10
Development 1 & 2 

10.1 Preformationism

•

•

But children do learn and the environment plays a great role 

Preformationism = babies and children are just unformed adults 
•
Freud’s psychosexual stages of development 
•
•

Believed that life was built around tension and pleasure
Stressed the importance of the first 5 years of life for the formation of adult 
personality
Freud was wrong about the specifics of each stage and his ideas about children’s 
sexual obsessions with their parents 

•

25

10.2 Piaget’s theory of cognitive 
development

- Children are not just “little adults” who know less; children just think 

and speak differently 

•

Schema: An action sequence governed by a core meaning (the basic 
building blocks of our mental models)

• Assimilation: how children translate information into a form they can 

understand (fit something to their current models)

• Accommodation: how children revise current knowledge in response 

to new experiences (create new models)

26

10.2 Piaget’s Stages of Cognitive 
Development

•

Sensorimotor stage: sensation + motion (birth to 2 years)

•

•

“being in the moment” (cid:0) object permanence : out of sight = stopped 
existing 
“A not B” error: cannot follow paths of motion to retrieve objects and 
repeat previously successful actions even if no longer appropriate

•

Preoperational (2-6 years)

•
•

Failures of conservation (number, liquid & solid quantity)
Failures of egocentricity: inability to take perspective of another

• Concrete operational (6 – 12 years) 

•

Logical failures: formal logic

•

Formal operational (12 and beyond)
• Adult-like reasoning 

27

Lecture 11
Language

lecture 11: Language

● Semantics => meaning 
● Phonology => how words get encoded in sounds and those sounds 

are understood and learned 

● Syntax => putting many words together to make complex units like 

sentences

● Pragmatics => ways in which we use language in real-life contexts 
and the assumptions that we make about speakers’ intentions that 
help us interpret what they mean

29

11.1 Semantics

● Words have an arbitrary, conventional relationship to their 

meanings 

● Meaning has to be learned from people (e.g. there is nothing 

subway-like about the subway)

● Average college student knows between 45,000 – 60,000 

words

● Language differs according to the environment

30

11.1 Reference problem

• How do children know what object to associate with a word?

Social referencing: follow other people’s gaze

1.
2. Novelty matching: children won’t attach a new word to something they already have a 

3.

name for
Intentionality: word only indicates meaning when you’re doing it intentionally, not when it 
happens by accident

4. Category assumption: children tend to assume basic category

31

11.2 Phonology

• Detection and discrimination 
•
• Neither of these require spoken language – it can be sign language 

Production 

32

11.3 Syntax

•

Collection of rules that allows us to string together individual words and make 
complex utterances with different meanings

• Noam Chomsky: languages are in fact “the same” (cid:0) differences in languages are all of a 

•

Syntax of all languages are just simple variants of one system 

certain few types
•
• Demonstrated that language is not just behaviorism 
Grammar and meaning can be totally separated: “Colorless green ideas sleep 
furiously”
•

Broca’s Aphasia: problems with syntax, but not meaning; can understand others’ 
speech but cannot talk

• Wernicke’s aphasia: problems with meaning but not syntax; can talk but not 

understand others’ speech

33

How do children understand 
syntax?

Instruction

•
•
• Conditioning/reinforcement

Imitation 

34

How do children understand 
syntax?

Instruction

•
•
• Conditioning/reinforcement

Imitation 

Language system that is ready to “take off” as soon as it gets 
normal input, i.e. surround it with normal adult language speakers 
•

Sensitive period for syntax (example: Genie)

35

11.4 Pragmatics

◉ Principle of charity: you will assume I am being truthful and 

informative; you will assume my goal is to communicate, and this 
helps you make sense of what would otherwise be hard to interpret 
or ambiguous sentences.

◉ Prosody/tone of voice: 

36

Why language matters

•

Linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)

structure of a language determines a native speaker’s 
perception and categorization of experience

As children acquire the grammatical rules of their language, 
they tend to overgeneralize those rules. This results in 
predictable speech errors around the age of 4 or 5, such as:

A. “You runned.”
B. “You ran.”
C. “Run you.”
D. “Ran you”

Memory researchers recommend that you match your studying 
environment as closely as possible to your testing environment to 
optimize recall. For example, if you take your exam in a quiet room with 
many other people, it is best to study in the library where it is quiet 
with many other people around you. This illustrates the concept of:

A. Deep processing
B. Shallow processing
C. Context dependence
D. Encoding specificity
