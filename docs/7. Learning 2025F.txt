The law of effect

"If the response in the presence of a stimulus is followed by a 
satisfying event, the association between the stimulus and the 
response is strengthened. If the response is followed by an annoying 
event, the association is weakened." -

Operating: Skinnerian software

Ratio: The reward is a function of the number of        

times the animal performed an action

Interval: The reward is a function of how long 

since the last reward

Fixed: The ratio or interval is always the same

Variable: The ratio or interval averages to a 

certain value

Some things we can’t learn via conditioning

Language can’t be conditioned

Key Ideas

• Organisms come into the world with reflexes and 
the ability to form associations, which enables 
them to predict the future.

• Optimal learning is sloppy, slow, selective, and 

intransigent.

• Behavior is “naturally selected” by its effects.
• Not everything is acquired through learning.

STUDY GUIDE CHALLENGE (next week)

• How could you use what you 
learned in class to “hack” your 
memory to have better recall 
before the exam? 

• Use these tricks to make a 

quick study guide for yourself.
