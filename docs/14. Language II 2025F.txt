“As long as independent 
journalism has existed, it has 
angered people who want 
stories told their way or not at 
all.”

Omission
Not writing certain things, or using certain words. Leaving one 
side out of an article, or a series of articles over a period of 
time; ignoring facts that tend to disprove one side of the 
story. 

Selection of Sources 
Whose words do you choose to highlight and use. Including 
more sources that support one view over another.  This bias 
can also be seen when a reporter uses phrases such as 
“experts believe,” “observers say,” or “most people believe.” 

Story Selection
What stories do you deem worthy of using your words to tell.  
A pattern of highlighting news stories that coincide with the 
agenda of one side, while ignoring stories that coincide with 
the opposing side. 

Placement 
Story placement is a measure of how important the editor considers the story.  Studies have shown 
that, in the case of the average newspaper reader and the average news story, most people read only 
the headline, or the first paragraph.

Labeling 
This can come in two forms. Firstly via labeling individuals of a certain group or belief with extreme 
labels, for example when the story uses more extreme sounding labels for the conservative than the 
liberal i.e. “ultra-conservative”, “far right”, but just “liberal” instead of “far left” or “ultra-liberal”. The 
other is not identifying an individual's biases before outline their view, calling them “an expert” or an 
“independent consumer group.”  

Spin
The words you choose to use to tell a story and the connotations and implications of those specific 
words. Spin involves tone – it’s a reporter’s subjective comments about objective facts; makes one 
side’s perspective look better than another.  

You also have to watch out for linguistic intergroup bias. 
A tendency for people to characterize positive things about their ingroup using more 
abstract expressions, but negative things about their outgroups using more abstract 
expressions.

Unsubstantiated Claims
Journalists sometimes make claims in their reporting without including evidence to back them up. 
This can occur in the headline of an article, or in the body. Statements that appear to be fact, but do 
not include specific evidence, are a key indication of this type of media bias.

So if I’m telling you that bias is inevitable. 
How can we address it?

The New York Times 
Stylebook

This is what it says about fairness and impartiality.  

The news report takes no sides and plays no favorites in what it covers or what it omits.

Conflict does not automatically dominate the news. An article about an initiative (by government, business or 
any institution) should normally report the development before setting out critics’ objections or focusing on its 
vulnerability, and the headline should reflect that priority.

The Times forgoes innuendo: an accusation that would not be acceptable if made outright cannot be implied 
through sly juxtaposition, the equivalent of a cocked eyebrow.

Writers and editors should guard against word choices that undermine neutrality. If one politician is firm or 
resolute, an opponent should not be rigid or dogmatic. If one country in a conflict has a leadership while the 
other has a regime, impartiality suffers. Negative overtones, in coverage of a figure in the news, are easily 
detected and repaired. But worshipful overtones can be a more insidious form of partiality, giving their subject 
an advantage over rivals

….And when, despite all efforts, The Times slips from neutrality, it is prompt and thorough in rectifying errors or 
lapses of fairness. See corrections and editors’ notes.
