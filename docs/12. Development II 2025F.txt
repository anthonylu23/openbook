Piagetian theories of cognitive development 

Problems with Piaget Infants have:

  – The rise of the smart babies

  – Problems with stages: “décalage”

Challenges to Constructivism

Children “construct” knowledge based on experiences with the world

Babies have “experience” by birth

Infants prefer their mother’s voice

Infants know A LOT about the physical world before they are 
capable of operating on it

If you do these tasks with 
M&Ms, children can suddenly 
solve these problems a year 
earlier!

Suggests the issue is not 
only cognitive, but 
motivational.

No.

Does Blue see Yertl’s head or tail?

Key Ideas

Piaget’s theory underemphasized what babies can do 
because it focused on their motor behavior

New ‘looking time’ methodologies reveal surprising 
competencies in infants

In addition, Piaget’s stage model is difficult to 
reconcile with discontinuities in developmental timing

New understandings see knowledge as built on a 
foundation of ‘core knowledge’

Babies move in time to music even 
before they learn to speak, new 
research shows.
