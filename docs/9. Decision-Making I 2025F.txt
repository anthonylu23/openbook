The problem with thinking!

Critical Thinking challenge

Key Ideas

• Decision making requires predicting the likelihood and value of 

outcomes.

• Because decision making is a newly-evolved cognitive algorithm, 

it has quite a few bugs.  

• For example, the predictions of human beings deviate 

considerably from the standards of Expected Utility Theory.

Critical Thinking challenge

Hopefully you’ve gained new 
insights to make you a better 
thinker the past few weeks.

Identity a bias in yourself or a 
friend, explain why it happens, 
and describe what they can do to 
overcome it!
