Oversimplifies; creates 
automatic responses -

resulting in errors and biases 
when shortcuts are misapplied

Involves conscious and

Requires more mental energy; 
doesn’t always fully “engage”-

resulting in biases from errors in 
reasoning

Why focus on behavior?

Example: physical activity

We focus on direct measurement of 
behavior wherever possible.

Attitudes, beliefs and intentions are 
important - but can sometimes be 
disconnected from actual behavior.

Evidence matters for good policies, products and 
services

The success of most ventures depends on how 
people react

Scientific knowledge about behavior shows that 
several important assumptions are not accurate

There are practical frameworks for applying that 
knowledge to real-world issues 

This not just about tweaks, and it’s not a distraction 
from your core business - it is your core business!

Changes to road layout 
reduces left turn speeds; 
messages about crashes 
can increase crashes

the ability of entrepreneurs to 
maintain accurate accounting by 
10% points compared to traditional 
approaches 

Giving a bonus that is 
lost if students do not 
reach targets is more

with green nudges: Evidence from China’s food-delivery industry. Science, 381(6662)

45

Deeper insights on defaults

Accepting a default is not the same as choosing                                
no change: defaults may change over time.

Defaults shape the behavior of countries: 80% of countries accept 
treaty adjudication by the International Court of Justice when it is the 
default; only 5% do so when the country must actively choose it.

Often we still fail to recognize the power of defaults: opt-out rates are 
consistently lower than expectations.

Defaults are more effective when they are seen as a 
recommendation or when they reflect the status quo.

Reducing friction doubled TB medication adherence

Moldova had some of the highest 
incidences of drug-resistant TB in the 
world, in part due to low drug 
adherence.

Barrier: having to take pills in the 
presence of a medical professional.

Friction reduction: patient records 
a video of them taking pills, rather 
than having to travel. 

47

Reducing friction doubled TB medication adherence

The change almost doubled adherence rates.

Each patient saved 58 hours and $30 in transport 
costs a month. 

The results led to the standard drug adherence 
process being changed to include self-taped video 
submissions.

“VOT is much better, I woke up in the morning 
and the first thing I would do was to use the 
tablet and take the pills”

controlled trial in Moldova. European Respiratory Journal, 56(2).

Simplifying everyday forms affects important outcomes  

Over the last decade, 
we’ve simplified 
hundreds of forms, 
letters and websites -
and measured the 
impact.

A typical improvement 
is around five 
percentage points.

Here’s just one 
example from our 
Singapore office, 
where people caught 
speeding were asked 
to complete a safer 
driving course.

How to simplify messages

Make sure that the key message is presented 
early, ideally in the first sentence or subject line.
Keep language simple.
Be specific about recommended actions.
Provide a single point of contact for responses.
Remove all information that is not needed to 
perform the action.

Highlighting the best places to stand reduced delays

London Underground wanted to reduce 
blocking of the train doors, in order to 
reduce wait times. 

Green vinyl on the platform shows where 
the doors would open when the arriving 
train completely stops at the platform

on the London underground. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 145, 63-80.

55

Dwell time decreased by 6.6% (2.3 seconds)

London Underground values one 
second savings in dwell time at 
King’s Cross station at £68,000 
($84k) worth of customer 
benefits

Customer benefits of $193k per 
year for London Underground at 
a cost of $30.8k (one platform)

If dwell times could be reduced 
by 2.7 seconds on a platform, 
train frequency could increase 
from 36 to 37 trains per hour, 
resulting in additional customer 
benefit of $4.44 million

Framing is a crucial factor in food purchases

57

Deeper insights on attention

Personalisation may be powerful -
but where is the line between helpful and 
unsettling? We need more data.

People may be strongly motivated to avoid 
information, no matter how much you highlight it.

What to choose is not obvious. Including  
progress bar in an online survey makes people 
less likely to finish it.

● Creating feelings of reciprocity

64

“Social proof” can be powerful

65

Deeper insights on social norms

If most people do not do the desired behavior, 
consider: a) what are people’s expectations;   
b) are the trends positive?

Watch out for:

● Backfires 
● Choosing the wrong reference group
● Emphasizing an undesirable norm
● “Common good” activities

66

Behaviors can spread widely through networks

But what’s the best way of ensuring that they do? 

When looking to “seed” behaviors, should you:

Select people randomly?

●
● Map relationships and find those who seem to 

have the most?

● Get randomly-selected people to nominate 

their friends?

A study tested these three options across dozens of 
villages in Honduras. 

They measured which villages saw the greatest 
uptake of the new behavior: multivitamin usage.

67

Reciprocity is a powerful force 

Direct reciprocity

Indirect reciprocity

We are more likely to help someone who has done something 
for us - just now, or in the past. Even small actions can make a 
difference. 

We are more likely to aid people who have helped others, 
even if we didn’t benefit, or to help others in general if we’ve 
been helped.

An employment advisor texts a jobseeker about a recruitment 
event. If they add: “I’ve booked you a place. Good luck, 
[name]”, people are much more likely to show up. 

A study showed that drivers were much more likely to let a 
waiting car out in front of them if they had just been let out 
themselves!

“Operational transparency” increases engagement  

In 2019, one in four women in Chile experienced 
intimate partner violence (IPV). Of the few who 
filed a criminal complaint, a third dropped out 
before the case concluded.

UNDP Chile and the Santiago Prosecutor’s Office 
partnered with BIT to test if light touch support to 
victims would reduce dropout rates.

Women filing a complaint either received the 
standard procedure or received a call and/or text 
at four key points in the process. 

The messages provided clarity about the process 
and encouragement to proceed.

Timing matters!

Moment of decision

Time of day

Day of week

Giving drivers a prompt to 
wear their seatbelts was
effective if it came 
immediately before driving –
but had no impact if it
came five minutes 
beforehand.

Financial analysts become 
more negative on conference 
calls as the day goes on.

Healthcare workers are less 
likely to wash hands as shifts go 
on.

Austin, J., Sigurdsson, S. O., & Rubin, Y. 
S. (2006)

Chen, J., et al. (2018)
Dai, H., et al. (2015)

The likelihood of someone 
missing a medical 
appointment is highest on a 
Monday, and decreases 
throughout the week.

(Shifting appointments later in 
the week led to 10% ↓ in no-
show rate.)

Ellis, D. A., et al. (2022)

73

Prompting at the moment of decision can be effective

BIT introduced prompts for employers to include flexible 
working options during the process of posting positions on 
the job site Indeed. 

These prompts led to a 20% increase in the number of 
jobs advertised as flexible – and these jobs attracted up 
to 30% more applicants.

Bringing benefits into the present

‘Temptation bundling’: bind an immediate reward to 
something less fun, but which benefits you in the longer term. 

You can only unlock the fun if you do the hard work at the 
same time.

For example, people can only access an ‘addictive’ 
audiobook when they are at the gym. 

Compared to just giving people access to the audiobook: 

Likelihood of a weekly gym visit increases ↑ 10%-14% 

●
● Average number of weekly gym visits ↑ 10%-12%

Help people make specific plans for the future

To address barriers to vaccination, we 
designed a WhatsApp chatbot that: 

● Provided personalized information on 
nearby vaccination clinics and hours

● Prompted users to make a plan to get 

vaccinated

● Reminded users of their vaccination 

plan

In a trial with 250,000 participants in 
Argentina, the chatbot more than tripled 
vaccine uptake compared to the control -
and doubled uptake compared to a static 
text message.
