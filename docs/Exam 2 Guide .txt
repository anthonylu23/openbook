Decision Making 2  (Michael Hallsworth) 

1.  Define behavioral insights and identify its three core features. 

2.  Identify and explain the two systems that drive behavior, according to Kahneman.  

3.  Define the EAST framework and its four components. 

Development 1 and 2 

1.  Define Preformationism. 

2.  Differentiate between continuous development and discontinuous development.  

3.  Jean Piaget — know who he is and what he was known for. 

4.  Understand, identify and exemplify the following key terms and how they fit into 

Piaget’s theory: 
a.  Schema 
b.  Assimilation 
c.  Accommodation 
d.  Equilibration 

5.  Define stage theory and identify the order of the stages. 

6.  Sensorimotor period 

a.  What babies can/cannot do 
b.  Object permanence — how it is tested, the key finding, implications 
c.  A not B error — what it is, how it is tested, key finding, implications 

7.  Preoperational period—When it takes place, key characteristic features, and cognitive 

failures: 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
a.  Conservation 
b.  Egocentrism 

8.  Concrete operational period— When it takes place, key characteristic features, and 

cognitive failures: 

a.  Examples of logic failures 

9.  Formal operational period— When it takes place, key characteristic features. 

10. Challenges to Piaget’s Theory — Understand that Piaget may have underestimated 
infants because his tasks relied on motor behavior rather than looking-time measures 

a.   Décalage — uneven development across domains (e.g., success in number 
conservation before liquid). 
b.   Horizontal vs. vertical faculties — language, number, and object knowledge may 
develop independently. 
c.   Core Knowledge Theory — infants are born with innate systems for reasoning about 
the world. 
d.   Habituation paradigm — used to test infant understanding by measuring looking time 
toward surprising events. 

11. Core domains of knowledge (from Core Knowledge Theory): 

a.  Objects 
b.  Number 
c.  Agents 
d.  Space 
e.  Morality 
f.  Groups 

12. Attachment theory 
a.  Secure 
b.  Anxious 
c.  Avoidant  
d.  Fearful-avoidant (sometimes called disorganized avoidant).  

13.  Modern view — Development builds on innate core systems refined by experience and 

learning. 

Language 1 

1.  Identify and explain ways that human language is unique from the communication 

systems of other animals. 

2.  Identify and explain the reference problem. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Identify and explain four ways that we solve the reference problem (be able to 

identify/generate examples of each). 

4.  Understand what phonology means and how children learn to produce sounds. 

5.  Explain why syntax is a critical property of language. 

6.  Explain what is meant by the idea of universal grammar, and be able to identify and 

explain evidence in support of this proposal (Hint: Noam Chomsky’s work provides part 
of the evidence to support the idea of universal grammar). 

7.  Identify and explain evidence that language rules (grammar) and words (meaning) are 

separable in the brain. 

8.  Identify three proposals regarding how children learn syntax (instruction, imitation, 
reinforcement) and be able to identify/explain evidence against each of these three 
proposals + give examples. 

9.  Explain what is meant by the claim that humans have a language instinct and summarize 

evidence in support of this claim. 

10. Explain the evidence in support of the idea that there is a sensitive period for acquiring 

syntax. 

11. Explain three pieces of evidence that language is not learned through general learning 

mechanisms (important!). 

12. Explain what is meant by pragmatics and why it is important. 

13. Identify and give examples of implicatures (e.g. stressing different parts of the same 

sentences creates completely different meanings!) 

Language 2 

1.  Identify and explain different types of media bias that involve the use of language: 

a.  Omission 
b.  Selection of sources 
c.  Story selection 
d.  Placement
