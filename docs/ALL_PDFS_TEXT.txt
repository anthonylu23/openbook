“The baby, assailed by eyes, ears, nose, skin, 
and entrails at once, feels it all as one great 
blooming, buzzing confusion”

–William James

Freud was WRONG about the specifics of each stage and 
his ideas about children’s sexual obsessions with their 
parents are not widely accepted

But the of stages become very popular in developmental 
psychology

How does development occur?

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Jean Piaget
(1896 - 1980)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Children “construct” schemas based on their experiences in the 

world

Constructivism

“Laurent [Piaget’s infant child] is lying on 
his back… He grasps in succession a 
[number of objects], stretches out his 
arm, and lets them fall.  He distinctly 
varies the position of the fall.  When the 
object falls in a new position, for 
example, on his pillow, he lets it fall two 
or three more times on the same place, 
as though to study the spatial relations”

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Schema: An action sequence governed by a core meaning (the basic 
building blocks of our mental models)

Assimilation: how children translate information into a form they can 
understand (fit something to their current models)

Accommodation: how children revise current knowledge in response to 
new experiences (create new models)

Equilibration: how children balance assimilation and accommodation to 
create stable understanding (making the most of current models while 
creating new ones when necessary)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

Infants have:

1) basic motor systems (reflexes)

2) sensory/perceptual systems

3) learning mechanisms of assimilation, 

accommodation, & equilibrium

According to Piaget, infants live primarily in the 
here-and-now

• Grade 6: Nihilist
• Grade 7-8: Awkward years
• Grade 9-10: Conformist
• Grade 11: Rebellious
• Grade 12: Semi-normal

Key Ideas

Piaget’s theory emphasizes children’s active creation 
of their own understandings

Assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration 
describe Piaget’s principles of learning

Piaget described four stages of development: 
sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational, 
and formal operational.

Each stage involves the development of a new way 
of understanding that overcomes earlier limitations

Piaget’s constructivism has made a lasting 
impression on theories of ideal education

Omission
Not writing certain things, or using certain words. Leaving one 
side out of an article, or a series of articles over a period of 
time; ignoring facts that tend to disprove one side of the 
story. 

Selection of Sources 
Whose words do you choose to highlight and use. Including 
more sources that support one view over another.  This bias 
can also be seen when a reporter uses phrases such as 
“experts believe,” “observers say,” or “most people believe.” 

Story Selection
What stories do you deem worthy of using your words to tell.  
A pattern of highlighting news stories that coincide with the 
agenda of one side, while ignoring stories that coincide with 
the opposing side. 

Placement 
Story placement is a measure of how important the editor considers the story.  Studies have shown 
that, in the case of the average newspaper reader and the average news story, most people read only 
the headline, or the first paragraph.

Labeling 
This can come in two forms. Firstly via labeling individuals of a certain group or belief with extreme 
labels, for example when the story uses more extreme sounding labels for the conservative than the 
liberal i.e. “ultra-conservative”, “far right”, but just “liberal” instead of “far left” or “ultra-liberal”. The 
other is not identifying an individual's biases before outline their view, calling them “an expert” or an 
“independent consumer group.”  

Spin
The words you choose to use to tell a story and the connotations and implications of those specific 
words. Spin involves tone – it’s a reporter’s subjective comments about objective facts; makes one 
side’s perspective look better than another.  

You also have to watch out for linguistic intergroup bias. 
A tendency for people to characterize positive things about their ingroup using more 
abstract expressions, but negative things about their outgroups using more abstract 
expressions. 

'Points of view' 
The Guardian 
1986

Unsubstantiated Claims
Journalists sometimes make claims in their reporting without including evidence to back them up. 
This can occur in the headline of an article, or in the body. Statements that appear to be fact, but do 
not include specific evidence, are a key indication of this type of media bias.

So if I’m telling you that bias is inevitable. 
How can we address it?

The New York Times 
Stylebook

This is what it says about fairness and impartiality.  

The news report takes no sides and plays no favorites in what it covers or what it omits.

Conflict does not automatically dominate the news. An article about an initiative (by government, business or 
any institution) should normally report the development before setting out critics’ objections or focusing on its 
vulnerability, and the headline should reflect that priority.

The Times forgoes innuendo: an accusation that would not be acceptable if made outright cannot be implied 
through sly juxtaposition, the equivalent of a cocked eyebrow.

Writers and editors should guard against word choices that undermine neutrality. If one politician is firm or 
resolute, an opponent should not be rigid or dogmatic. If one country in a conflict has a leadership while the 
other has a regime, impartiality suffers. Negative overtones, in coverage of a figure in the news, are easily 
detected and repaired. But worshipful overtones can be a more insidious form of partiality, giving their subject 
an advantage over rivals

….And when, despite all efforts, The Times slips from neutrality, it is prompt and thorough in rectifying errors or 
lapses of fairness. See corrections and editors’ notes.

The law of effect

"If the response in the presence of a stimulus is followed by a 
satisfying event, the association between the stimulus and the 
response is strengthened. If the response is followed by an annoying 
event, the association is weakened." -

Some things we can’t learn via conditioning

Language can’t be conditioned

Key Ideas

• Organisms come into the world with reflexes and 
the ability to form associations, which enables 
them to predict the future.

• Optimal learning is sloppy, slow, selective, and 

intransigent.

• Behavior is “naturally selected” by its effects.
• Not everything is acquired through learning.

Key Ideas

• Memory is not unitary, but instead results from a 

number of different subsystems.

• Explicit memories are represented in distributed 

networks.

• These distributed networks result in levels of 

processing, encoding-specificity, and context effects 
in explicit memory.

• The hippocampus helps with the formation of new 

explicit memories.

• As with almost everything else in psychology, 
memory has a non-conscious component.

The problem with thinking!

Critical Thinking challenge

Key Ideas

• Decision making requires predicting the likelihood and value of 

outcomes.

• Because decision making is a newly-evolved cognitive algorithm, 

it has quite a few bugs.  

• For example, the predictions of human beings deviate 

considerably from the standards of Expected Utility Theory.

Critical Thinking challenge

Hopefully you’ve gained new 
insights to make you a better 
thinker the past few weeks.

Identity a bias in yourself or a 
friend, explain why it happens, 
and describe what they can do to 
overcome it!

Lecture 7
Learning

Lecture 7: Learning 

Respond (basic hardware), predict (pavlovian software), & 
operate (skinnerian software)

Responding: 
•
•
•

Sensation – the ability to discriminate stimuli 
Reflex – hardwired stimulus-response circuits
Habituation – the circuit breaker 

Predicting: run before the cat sees you
•

Classical conditioning (Pavlov)

•

•

•

10

7.1 Classical conditioning

•

1) Learn associations

• Unconditioned stimulus (cid:0) unconditioned 

response (innate, reflex)

• Conditioned stimulus (cid:0) conditioned response

2) Learn sloppily→Generalization: take what 
you learned in a situation and extend it to 
other similar things (little Albert)

•

•

11

7.1 Classical conditioning

•

•

•

•

•

3) Learn sparingly →Blocking – learning one pattern of relationships rather 
than many

*First learned association “blocks” future ones
4) Learn slowly →Latent inhibition

5) Unlearn slowly →Extinction: previously learned association is 
weakened when pattern is broken

6) Relearn quickly →Spontaneous recovery: after extinction, can relearn 
pattern more quickly

12

7.2 Operant conditioning

•

•

Repeat what works (law of effect): 
•
•

If I do something and something good happens, do that again
If I do something and something bad happens, don’t do it 
again

Schedules of reinforcement 

•

•

Ratio: reward is a function of the number 
of times action is performed.
Interval: reward is a function of how 
long since the last reward.

•

•

Fixed: the ratio or interval is always the 
same 
Variable: ratio or interval averages to a 
certain value.

13

Lecture 8
Memory

Lecture 8: Memory

•

Sensory memory: short-term (a few seconds or less)
•
•

Iconic – visual memory
Echoic – auditory memory 

• Working memory 
Currently active 
Limited capacity: 7 +/- 2 

•
•
Long term memory 
•
•

Explicit – semantic & episodic
Implicit – priming & procedural 

•

15

8.1 Explicit memory

• Distributed representation
•

Semantic memory: factual knowledge 
•
Episodic memory: what you did on Sat. night

Lexical decision task: linked in memory -> fast

•
•

Retrieval: recreating the pattern of neurons that was 
created by those experiences 
•

Retrieval cues serve as “seeds” 

16

8.1 Explicit memory

● Consequences of distributed representations:

•

•

Levels of processing 

Memory is better when encoding emphasizes 
“deep” aspects of a stimulus (such as meaning) 
vs. “shallow” aspects of a stimulus (such as 
place)

Encoding specificity

you will remember better if the way you first 
encoded the information is consistent with the 
way you’ll eventually try to remember it

17

8.1 Explicit memory

● Consequences of distributed representations:

• Context dependence

→ you will remember better if you are 
physically located in the same place you 
learned something

State-dependent memory: not the physical 
place, but the psychological state 

18

8.2 Implicit memory

Priming 

Procedural memory

•
•
• Anterograde amnesia: cannot form new memories since brain injury
•
Retrograde amnesia: cannot remember the past up until the brain 
injury

•

Patient H.M. is really bad at recall and recognition (explicit), but still 
has implicit memories

19

Lecture 9
Decision making

9.1 Expected Utility Theory

• As a decision-maker, your job is to maximize value 
•

Two kinds of errors: 
•
Errors of odds
•
Errors of valuation 
•
Expected value = odds of gain X value of gain 

21

9.2 Errors of odds

•

•

•
•

•

Sample size neglect - larger samples will be less likely to show deviations from 
chance or from the normal rate

Gambler’s fallacy - belief that the likelihood of a chance event is influenced by the 
nature of the events that preceded it 

Conjunction fallacy – probability of X is always higher than probability of X and Y

Availability bias - tendency to think that examples of things that come readily to mind 
are more representative than is actually the case

Planning Fallacy - underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task, 
despite knowledge that previous tasks have generally taken longer than planned

22

9.3 Errors of valuation

•

•

•

•

Presentism – tendency to overweight things that are present in mind right now 
Delay of gratification- holding out now for better outcomes later

Endowment effect – application of prospect theory with respect to ownership 
(losses loom larger than gains)

Temporal discounting – discounting the value of something if it’s further away in 
time 

Comparing to the past – preferring the option that shows gradual increase from 
the past 

23

Lecture 10
Development 1 & 2 

10.1 Preformationism

•

•

But children do learn and the environment plays a great role 

Preformationism = babies and children are just unformed adults 
•
Freud’s psychosexual stages of development 
•
•

Believed that life was built around tension and pleasure
Stressed the importance of the first 5 years of life for the formation of adult 
personality
Freud was wrong about the specifics of each stage and his ideas about children’s 
sexual obsessions with their parents 

•

25

10.2 Piaget’s theory of cognitive 
development

- Children are not just “little adults” who know less; children just think 

and speak differently 

•

Schema: An action sequence governed by a core meaning (the basic 
building blocks of our mental models)

• Assimilation: how children translate information into a form they can 

understand (fit something to their current models)

• Accommodation: how children revise current knowledge in response 

to new experiences (create new models)

26

10.2 Piaget’s Stages of Cognitive 
Development

•

Sensorimotor stage: sensation + motion (birth to 2 years)

•

•

“being in the moment” (cid:0) object permanence : out of sight = stopped 
existing 
“A not B” error: cannot follow paths of motion to retrieve objects and 
repeat previously successful actions even if no longer appropriate

•

Preoperational (2-6 years)

•
•

Failures of conservation (number, liquid & solid quantity)
Failures of egocentricity: inability to take perspective of another

• Concrete operational (6 – 12 years) 

•

Logical failures: formal logic

•

Formal operational (12 and beyond)
• Adult-like reasoning 

27

Lecture 11
Language

lecture 11: Language

● Semantics => meaning 
● Phonology => how words get encoded in sounds and those sounds 

are understood and learned 

● Syntax => putting many words together to make complex units like 

sentences

● Pragmatics => ways in which we use language in real-life contexts 
and the assumptions that we make about speakers’ intentions that 
help us interpret what they mean

29

11.1 Semantics

● Words have an arbitrary, conventional relationship to their 

meanings 

● Meaning has to be learned from people (e.g. there is nothing 

subway-like about the subway)

● Average college student knows between 45,000 – 60,000 

words

● Language differs according to the environment

30

11.1 Reference problem

• How do children know what object to associate with a word?

Social referencing: follow other people’s gaze

1.
2. Novelty matching: children won’t attach a new word to something they already have a 

3.

name for
Intentionality: word only indicates meaning when you’re doing it intentionally, not when it 
happens by accident

4. Category assumption: children tend to assume basic category

31

11.2 Phonology

• Detection and discrimination 
•
• Neither of these require spoken language – it can be sign language 

Production 

32

11.3 Syntax

•

Collection of rules that allows us to string together individual words and make 
complex utterances with different meanings

• Noam Chomsky: languages are in fact “the same” (cid:0) differences in languages are all of a 

•

Syntax of all languages are just simple variants of one system 

certain few types
•
• Demonstrated that language is not just behaviorism 
Grammar and meaning can be totally separated: “Colorless green ideas sleep 
furiously”
•

Broca’s Aphasia: problems with syntax, but not meaning; can understand others’ 
speech but cannot talk

• Wernicke’s aphasia: problems with meaning but not syntax; can talk but not 

understand others’ speech

33

How do children understand 
syntax?

Instruction

•
•
• Conditioning/reinforcement

Imitation 

34

How do children understand 
syntax?

Instruction

•
•
• Conditioning/reinforcement

Imitation 

Language system that is ready to “take off” as soon as it gets 
normal input, i.e. surround it with normal adult language speakers 
•

Sensitive period for syntax (example: Genie)

35

11.4 Pragmatics

◉ Principle of charity: you will assume I am being truthful and 

informative; you will assume my goal is to communicate, and this 
helps you make sense of what would otherwise be hard to interpret 
or ambiguous sentences.

◉ Prosody/tone of voice: 

36

Why language matters

•

Linguistic relativity (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)

structure of a language determines a native speaker’s 
perception and categorization of experience

The success of most ventures depends on how 
people react

Scientific knowledge about behavior shows that 
several important assumptions are not accurate

There are practical frameworks for applying that 
knowledge to real-world issues 

This not just about tweaks, and it’s not a distraction 
from your core business - it is your core business!

with green nudges: Evidence from China’s food-delivery industry. Science, 381(6662)

45

Deeper insights on defaults

Accepting a default is not the same as choosing                                
no change: defaults may change over time.

Defaults shape the behavior of countries: 80% of countries accept 
treaty adjudication by the International Court of Justice when it is the 
default; only 5% do so when the country must actively choose it.

Often we still fail to recognize the power of defaults: opt-out rates are 
consistently lower than expectations.

Defaults are more effective when they are seen as a 
recommendation or when they reflect the status quo.

Reducing friction doubled TB medication adherence

Moldova had some of the highest 
incidences of drug-resistant TB in the 
world, in part due to low drug 
adherence.

Barrier: having to take pills in the 
presence of a medical professional.

Friction reduction: patient records 
a video of them taking pills, rather 
than having to travel. 

47

Reducing friction doubled TB medication adherence

The change almost doubled adherence rates.

Each patient saved 58 hours and $30 in transport 
costs a month. 

The results led to the standard drug adherence 
process being changed to include self-taped video 
submissions.

and the first thing I would do was to use the 
tablet and take the pills”

we’ve simplified 
hundreds of forms, 
letters and websites -
and measured the 
impact.

is around five 
percentage points.

where people caught 
speeding were asked 
to complete a safer 
driving course.

How to simplify messages

Make sure that the key message is presented 
early, ideally in the first sentence or subject line.
Keep language simple.
Be specific about recommended actions.

Remove all information that is not needed to 
perform the action.

year for London Underground at 
a cost of $30.8k (one platform)

If dwell times could be reduced 
by 2.7 seconds on a platform, 
train frequency could increase 
from 36 to 37 trains per hour, 
resulting in additional customer 
benefit of $4.44 million

64

“Social proof” can be powerful

65

Deeper insights on social norms

If most people do not do the desired behavior, 
consider: a) what are people’s expectations;   
b) are the trends positive?

Watch out for:

● Backfires 
● Choosing the wrong reference group
● Emphasizing an undesirable norm
● “Common good” activities

66

Behaviors can spread widely through networks

But what’s the best way of ensuring that they do? 

When looking to “seed” behaviors, should you:

Select people randomly?

●
● Map relationships and find those who seem to 

have the most?

● Get randomly-selected people to nominate 

their friends?

A study tested these three options across dozens of 
villages in Honduras. 

They measured which villages saw the greatest 
uptake of the new behavior: multivitamin usage.

Reciprocity is a powerful force 

Direct reciprocity

Indirect reciprocity

We are more likely to help someone who has done something 
for us - just now, or in the past. Even small actions can make a 
difference. 

We are more likely to aid people who have helped others, 
even if we didn’t benefit, or to help others in general if we’ve 
been helped.

An employment advisor texts a jobseeker about a recruitment 
event. If they add: “I’ve booked you a place. Good luck, 
[name]”, people are much more likely to show up. 

A study showed that drivers were much more likely to let a 
waiting car out in front of them if they had just been let out 
themselves!

“Operational transparency” increases engagement  

In 2019, one in four women in Chile experienced 
intimate partner violence (IPV). Of the few who 
filed a criminal complaint, a third dropped out 
before the case concluded.

UNDP Chile and the Santiago Prosecutor’s Office 
partnered with BIT to test if light touch support to 
victims would reduce dropout rates.

Women filing a complaint either received the 
standard procedure or received a call and/or text 
at four key points in the process. 

The messages provided clarity about the process 
and encouragement to proceed.

likely to wash hands as shifts go 
on.

Austin, J., Sigurdsson, S. O., & Rubin, Y. 
S. (2006)

Chen, J., et al. (2018)
Dai, H., et al. (2015)

The likelihood of someone 
missing a medical 
appointment is highest on a 
Monday, and decreases 
throughout the week.

(Shifting appointments later in 
the week led to 10% ↓ in no-
show rate.)

Ellis, D. A., et al. (2022)

Prompting at the moment of decision can be effective

BIT introduced prompts for employers to include flexible 
working options during the process of posting positions on 
the job site Indeed. 

These prompts led to a 20% increase in the number of 
jobs advertised as flexible – and these jobs attracted up 
to 30% more applicants.

Bringing benefits into the present

‘Temptation bundling’: bind an immediate reward to 
something less fun, but which benefits you in the longer term. 

You can only unlock the fun if you do the hard work at the 
same time.

For example, people can only access an ‘addictive’ 
audiobook when they are at the gym. 

Compared to just giving people access to the audiobook: 

Likelihood of a weekly gym visit increases ↑ 10%-14% 

●
● Average number of weekly gym visits ↑ 10%-12%

field experiment. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision 
Processes, 161, 2035.

Help people make specific plans for the future

To address barriers to vaccination, we 
designed a WhatsApp chatbot that: 

● Provided personalized information on 
nearby vaccination clinics and hours

● Prompted users to make a plan to get 

vaccinated

● Reminded users of their vaccination 

plan

In a trial with 250,000 participants in 
Argentina, the chatbot more than tripled 
vaccine uptake compared to the control -
and doubled uptake compared to a static 
text message.
