Development

“The baby, assailed by eyes, ears, nose, skin, 
and entrails at once, feels it all as one great 
blooming, buzzing confusion”

–William James

How does development occur?

Nature vs. Nurture

Nature ➔ Biology
Nurture ➔ Environment

Was Freud right or wrong?

Freud was WRONG about the specifics of each stage and 
his ideas about children’s sexual obsessions with their 
parents are not widely accepted

But the of stages become very popular in developmental 
psychology

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Jean Piaget
(1896 - 1980)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Children “construct” schemas based on their experiences in the 

world

Constructivism

“Laurent [Piaget’s infant child] is lying on 
his back… He grasps in succession a 
[number of objects], stretches out his 
arm, and lets them fall.  He distinctly 
varies the position of the fall.  When the 
object falls in a new position, for 
example, on his pillow, he lets it fall two 
or three more times on the same place, 
as though to study the spatial relations”

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Schema: An action sequence governed by a core meaning (the basic 
building blocks of our mental models)

Assimilation: how children translate information into a form they can 
understand (fit something to their current models)

Accommodation: how children revise current knowledge in response to 
new experiences (create new models)

Equilibration: how children balance assimilation and accommodation to 
create stable understanding (making the most of current models while 
creating new ones when necessary)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

Infants have:

1) basic motor systems (reflexes)

2) sensory/perceptual systems

3) learning mechanisms of assimilation, 

accommodation, & equilibrium

According to Piaget, infants live primarily in the 
here-and-now

Sensimotor (birth to 2 years)

Stages of development

1) Toddlers begin to represent experiences in 
language, imagery, & symbolic thought

2) Cannot perform “operations” (reversible 

mental activities)

3) Focus on a single, perceptually-salient 

aspect of an event (centration)

Preoperational (2 - 6 years)

Preoperational (2 - 6 years)

Sensimotor (birth to 2 years)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

Children can reason logically about concrete 
objects and events

However, they have difficulty thinking in purely 
abstract terms in combining information 
systematically

Concrete operational (6 - 12 years)

Preoperational (2 - 6 years)

Sensimotor (birth to 2 years)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

Concrete operational (6 - 12 years)

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Concrete operational failures: formal logic

• All the bears in the North Pole 

are white

• Karen saw a bear in the North 

Pole

• What color was the bear that 

Karen saw?

Concrete operational failures: formal logic

• All the bears in the North Pole 

are white

• Annie saw a bear in the North 

Pole

• What color was the bear that 

Annie saw?

Adult:  “It was white (duh!)”
10-yr-old: “How do I know, I didn’t see it (duh!)”

Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development

Stages of development

1) Children (and adults) can think about 

abstractions and hypotheticals

2) Can perform systematic “experiments” to 

draw conclusions about the world

Formal operational (12 and 
beyond)

Concrete operational (6 - 12 years)

Preoperational (2 - 6 years)

Sensimotor (birth to 2 years)

My own developmental stages:

Development

• Grade 1-5: Sweet kid
• Grade 6: Nihilist
• Grade 7-8: Awkward years
• Grade 9-10: Conformist
• Grade 11: Rebellious
• Grade 12: Semi-normal

Key Ideas

Piaget’s theory emphasizes children’s active creation 
of their own understandings

Assimilation, accommodation, and equilibration 
describe Piaget’s principles of learning

Piaget described four stages of development: 
sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational, 
and formal operational.

Each stage involves the development of a new way 
of understanding that overcomes earlier limitations

Piaget’s constructivism has made a lasting 
impression on theories of ideal education
