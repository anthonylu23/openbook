(such as place)

Consequences of distributed representations in memory

1) Levels of processing

“Deep” encoding leads to a 
highly distributed 
representation.

Re-instantiation of this 
representation can be 
accomplished with a wide 
number of retrieval cues.

Consequences of distributed representations in memory

1) Levels of processing

“Shallow” encoding 
leads to a sparse 
representation.

Re-instantiation of this 
representation can be 
accomplished with a small 
number of retrieval cues 
(maybe only one)

2)  Encoding specificity

Memory is better when a retrieval cue overlaps with those available 
during encoding

Rhyme 

Do these words rhyme? 

Associate   

Are these words semantically related?

2)  Encoding specificity

Task #1 (e.g., associate)

Task #2 (e.g., rhyme)

If the retrieval cue overlaps 
with task #1, then memory 
will be better for items 
encoded as part of #1

However, some tasks do 
indeed lead to more robust 
representations than others

Key Ideas

• Memory is not unitary, but instead results from a 

number of different subsystems.

• Explicit memories are represented in distributed 

networks.

• These distributed networks result in levels of 

processing, encoding-specificity, and context effects 
in explicit memory.

• The hippocampus helps with the formation of new 

explicit memories.

• As with almost everything else in psychology, 
memory has a non-conscious component.

STUDY GUIDE CHALLENGE

• Use these principles to make your memory better!
