Linguistic Relativity (Sapir Whorf hypothesis): 
The structure of a language affects its speakers' 
worldview or cognition.

Semantics

What do these signs mean?

Semantics

•The average college 
student knows 45,000-
60,000 words

• 1st birthday Þ 20th 
birthday = 6,939 days

• 6.5 new words/day (one 
every 3hrs)

Semantics

•Language differs according to the environment

•The vocabulary of kids from wealthy families is dramatically 
higher than kids from poor families

Semantics

Newborn babies

• Newborn babies prefer 
to listen to their own 
mother’s voice over 
another mother’s

• To their native language 
rather than a foreign 
language

• And to human speech 
than other sounds

Solving the Reference Problem

1) Social referencing

2) Novelty matching

3) Intentionality

4) Category assumption

Making infinite use of finite media

Syntax

Universal grammar

• All languages have identifiable subjects, verbs, + 

objects (SVO)

• Most languages are SVO (e.g., English) or SOV (e.g. 

Japanese, German)  

– fewer are VSO 

– <1% are OVS

– none are OSV   

Syntax

Rules (grammar) and Words (meaning) are separable

“Colorless green ideas sleep furiously”

Syntax

Universal grammar

• Children spontaneously ‘invent’ grammatical structure

Syntax

Rules (grammar) and Words (meaning) are separable

Broca’s aphasia vs. Wernicke’s aphasia

Syntax

Rules (grammar) and Words (meaning) are separable

Broca’s aphasia vs. Wernicke’s aphasia

Broca’s aphasics (motor speech area) can understand 
others’ speech but cannot talk, Wernicke’s aphasics 
(comprehension area) can talk but not understand others’ 
speech

Syntax

How do children learn the rules of their language?

Sensitive period for syntax

“Mike paint.”

“Applesauce buy store.”

“Neil come happy; Neil not come sad.”

“Genie have Momma have baby grow up.

“I like elephant eat peanut.”

Pragmatics

Pragmatics

The Principle of Charity: 

you will assume I am being 
truthful and informative; you 
will assume my goal is to 
communicate, and this helps 
you make sense of what would 
otherwise be hard to interpret 
or ambiguous sentences.

Pragmatics

Implicature

Listeners expect speakers to be:

• informative

• truthful

• relevant

• clear

• unambiguous

• brief

• orderly

Dear Prof. Chomsky:

I am very pleased to be able to recommend Annie to you. 
Annie is a model student. She dresses well and is extremely 
punctual. I have known Annie for 13 years now, and in every 
way I have found her to be most cooperative.  Her brother is 
very charming.

Sincerely,

Prof. Jay Van Bavel

Other aspects of pragmatics

Read the sentence 7 times aloud, emphasizing 
a different word each time. How does it change 
the meaning?

• Language appears to be unique to humans

Key Ideas

• Semantics refers to meaning, the interface 

between ideas and words

• Phonology refers to the sounds that words 

are embedded in

• Syntax refers to the rules that govern how 

sentences are formed, and is responsible for 
our ability to use a finite number of words to 
make an infinite number of sentences

• Pragmatics refers to the ways in which we 
use language in real-life contexts and the 
assumptions that we make about speakers’ 
intentions that help us interpret what they 
mean
